While motherhood is often a positive and fulfilling experience, for many women, it is associated with suffering, ill health, and even death. The risks or conditions that were pre-existing or the ones that had developed during the pregnancy highly influence the health of a mother. Thus, improving the well-being of mothers, infants, and children is a crucial health goal. Their well-being influences the health of the next generation.</div>

                    <div class="box_1_para">Laparoscopy is a type of surgical procedure that doesn’t require large incisions; hence, it is called keyhole surgery or minimally invasive surgery. This is performed using an instrument called the laparoscope, which is basically a small tube with a light source and a camera. Small instruments are used to conduct the surgery, while the area is pumped with gas to make space. This way is more advantageous and has very fewer chances of complications. Advantages include faster recovery time, less bleeding post-op, and minor scars. Complications that could occur include minor bleeding, nausea, or infection.</div>

Sometimes the cervical muscles weaken, causing them to shorten or open up easily, resulting in late abortion or preterm delivery. To treat this, a cervical cerclage or cervical stitch is made, which is basically a suture tied around the cervix.</div>

In this procedure, the surgeon detaches the uterus from the ovaries and fallopian tubes, connecting blood vessels and other parts that it is connected to, and then carefully removes it from the body through the vagina. Abdominal hysterectomy is a process where the uterus is removed from our body through an incision made on the lower abdomen. It could be partial—only the uterus removed—or total—both the uterus and cervix are removed.</div>
